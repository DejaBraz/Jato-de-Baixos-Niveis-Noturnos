# Summary

Nocturnal Low-Level Jets (NLLJs) are nighttime wind maxima in the lower troposphere, typically forming between 900–650 hPa due to inertial oscillations and radiative cooling of the boundary layer. Over South America, NLLJs play a fundamental role in meridional moisture transport from the Amazon Basin toward subtropical regions, significantly influencing rainfall patterns, severe convective events, and the hydrological cycle. Their occurrence is particularly relevant during austral summer, when they contribute to the formation of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and the development of mesoscale convective systems.

**JBNN** is an open-source Python package that implements an objective identification method for NLLJs based on the intensity index proposed by Rife et al. (2010), adapted for isobaric levels (900–650 hPa). The tool provides a complete and automated workflow, from downloading ERA5 reanalysis data and preprocessing with CDO, to computing the NLLJ index and generating climatological maps. Its open-source nature ensures reproducibility and transparency, making it a valuable resource for atmospheric scientists and operational forecasters.

# Motivation and Scientific Relevance

Understanding the dynamics of NLLJs is crucial for regional climate analysis and disaster risk management. These jets enhance low-level moisture flux convergence, fueling convective systems that often lead to extreme precipitation and flooding. Despite their importance, existing detection methods are often limited to proprietary codes or require advanced programming expertise, hindering reproducibility and accessibility.

**JBNN** bridges this gap by offering:
- A fully reproducible workflow using **open data** (ERA5) and **open-source tools**.
- A user-friendly interface for climatological studies and event-specific diagnostics.
- Integration with widely used Python libraries (`xarray`, `cartopy`, `matplotlib`), allowing seamless incorporation into scientific pipelines.

By lowering technical barriers, **JBNN** facilitates research on the variability and impacts of NLLJs, contributing to improved understanding of moisture transport and associated extreme weather events.

# Software Architecture and Implementation

The **JBNN** package is structured into modular components:
- **Data acquisition**: `Download ERA.ipynb` retrieves ERA5 hourly wind and geopotential fields through the Copernicus Climate Data Store API.
- **Preprocessing**: `run_JBNN.sh` leverages **Climate Data Operators (CDO)** to compute daily means, vertical shear, and wind magnitude.
- **Index computation**: `compute_index()` calculates the NLLJ intensity index, following Rife et al. (2010), adapted for 900–650 hPa levels.
- **Visualization**:
    - `Mapa JBNN.py`: Generates seasonal climatology maps of NLLJ frequency and intensity.
    - `DIAS_NLLJ.py`: Produces daily maps for case-study analysis.
    - `diascomjato.ipynb`: Interactive Jupyter notebook for exploratory workflows.

The codebase emphasizes **readability**, **parallel processing**, and **compatibility with NetCDF standards**, making it suitable for both research and operational environments.
